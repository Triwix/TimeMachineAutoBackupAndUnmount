# Time Machine Auto-Unmount After Backup Automation

When a time machine (tm) disk is mounted, an automation is triggered to ask tm if a backup is due per the backup freqeuncy set in macOS's native tm settings, unmounts the disk if unneeded, and if needed, backs up and then unmounts. The purpose of this automation is due to my need for regular backups on my macbook which I also use as desktop via a thunderbolt dock with a tm disk connected to it. However, I didn't want to think about having to unmount everytime I unplug the dock's cable from the macbook, hence, AutoUnmountTimeMachine was born.

Built with love (and GPT-5.3-Codex Extra High) ❤️

Behavior:
- `launchd` triggers a script on login and any volume mount.
- The script asks macOS to decide backup timing with `tmutil startbackup --auto --block`.
- If macOS starts (or is already running) a backup, the script waits for completion and then unmounts the disk.
- If macOS does not start a backup, the script unmounts the Time Machine disk.

## Requirements
- macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or later
- Time Machine already configured with at least one local destination
- Full Disk Access granted to the process running the script (see notes below for more on how and why)
- Script runs as a per-user LaunchAgent (not a daemon)

## Install
Use either Finder drag-and-drop or Terminal.

<details>

<summary> Option A: Finder (Drag-and-Drop)</summary>

1. Open the folder containing these files:
   - `timemachine-auto.sh`
   - `com.user.timemachine-auto.plist`
2. In Finder, press `Shift+Command+G` and open: `~/Library/Scripts`
   - Create the folder if it does not exist.
3. Drag `timemachine-auto.sh` into `~/Library/Scripts/`.
4. In Finder, press `Shift+Command+G` and open: `~/Library/LaunchAgents`
   - Create the folder if it does not exist.
5. Drag `com.user.timemachine-auto.plist` into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.
6. Open Terminal and run:
```bash
chmod +x "$HOME/Library/Scripts/timemachine-auto.sh"
```
7. Load the LaunchAgent:
```bash
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.timemachine-auto.plist"
```

<summary>Option B: Terminal</summary>
- Important: run these commands from the directory that contains this README, `timemachine-auto.sh`, and `com.user.timemachine-auto.plist`.

```bash
# Go to folder with script + plist
cd "/path/to/folder-containing-these-files"

# Create script destination folder if missing
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Scripts"

# Copy script
cp ./timemachine-auto.sh "$HOME/Library/Scripts/timemachine-auto.sh"

# Make script executable
chmod +x "$HOME/Library/Scripts/timemachine-auto.sh"

# Create LaunchAgent folder if missing
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents"

# Install plist
cp ./com.user.timemachine-auto.plist "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.timemachine-auto.plist"

# Load LaunchAgent (Automates the triggering of timemachine-auto.sh)
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.timemachine-auto.plist"

# Unload LaunchAgent (Disable the auto triggering of timemachine-auto.sh)
launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)"/com.user.timemachine-auto 2>/dev/null || true

# Optional: This command just ensures if the LaunchAgent is enabled
launchctl enable "gui/$(id -u)"/com.user.timemachine-auto
```

## Things to be aware of
#### Full Disk Access
- Grant Full Disk Access in System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Full Disk Access. Add entries based on how you run the script:
  - Manual runs: add your terminal app (Terminal, iTerm, etc.).
  - Automatic LaunchAgent runs: add `/bin/bash` (the .plist runs the script through `/bin/bash`).
- I know this sounds scary, but I couldn't find a way to get it to work right without it, feel free to audit both scripts for safety!
- After adding entries:
  - Ensure each toggle is ON.
  - Quit and reopen the added app(s).
  - Reload the LaunchAgent (bootout/bootstrap) before re-testing.
- Common related errors in logs:
  - `Operation not permitted`
  - `Full Disk Access`
  - `not authorized`
  - `access denied`

#### Multiple Destinations
- This script is designed for single local Time Machine destination setups. If you have multiple local destinations:
  - Set `PREFERRED_DESTINATION_ID` to the one you want managed.
  - Get IDs with `tmutil destinationinfo`.
- If you have network destinations (iCloud, Time Capsule, NAS):
  - The script waits for ANY backup to complete, not only local disk backup.
  - This is safe but may keep local disk mounted longer than necessary.

#### StartOnMount Note
- `StartOnMount` triggers for all mounted volumes (USB, DMG, network, etc.).
- The script exits quickly when the configured local Time Machine disk is not mounted.

#### First Run vs Later Runs
- First run after mount evaluates destination, runs macOS auto decision, waits if needed, then unmounts.
- If another instance is already running, lock protection makes the new trigger exit.
- If a stale lock exists without a PID and is at least 60 seconds old, the script reclaims it and continues.

## Configuration

### Script Configuration (`timemachine-auto.sh`)
User config block:
- `PREFERRED_DESTINATION_ID=""`
  - Optional destination UUID. Get destination IDs with `tmutil destinationinfo`. Leave empty to auto-select when exactly one local destination is configured.
  - Rules: Must be a full UUID format: `XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX` (hex digits). If format is invalid, script logs an error, shows a notification, and exits
- `BACKUP_POLL_SECONDS=15`
  - Poll interval while checking backup status.
- `BACKUP_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS=43200`
  - Maximum total wait for an active backup before leaving disk mounted.
- `POST_BACKUP_SETTLE_SECONDS=10`
  - Delay after backup completes before unmount, to let final I/O settle.
- `UNMOUNT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3`
  - Number of unmount retries before failure.
- `LOCK_STALE_SECONDS=21600`
  - Lock age threshold before a stale lock is reclaimed.
- `LOCK_REFRESH_SECONDS=600`
  - How often to refresh lock metadata while waiting in long-running loops.

Backward compatibility:
- If `EJECT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` is set, it overrides `UNMOUNT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`.

Logging behavior:
- Log file rotates at 1 MiB.
- Up to 3 rotated files are kept (`.1`, `.2`, `.3`).

### Configuration Examples
Default (good for most users):
```bash
PREFERRED_DESTINATION_ID=""
BACKUP_POLL_SECONDS=15
BACKUP_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS=43200
POST_BACKUP_SETTLE_SECONDS=10
UNMOUNT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
LOCK_STALE_SECONDS=21600
LOCK_REFRESH_SECONDS=600
```

Less frequent status polling:
```bash
BACKUP_POLL_SECONDS=30
```

Very large first backup:
```bash
BACKUP_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS=86400
LOCK_STALE_SECONDS=86400
```

## Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check LaunchAgent status
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)"/com.user.timemachine-auto

# Check running script process
ps aux | grep '[t]imemachine-auto.sh'

# Follow logs live with this command, open the log file itself, or find it in Console.app -> Log Reports -> tm-auto-backup.log
tail -f "$HOME/Library/Logs/AutoTMLogs/tm-auto-backup.log"

# Manual one-off test run
"$HOME/Library/Scripts/timemachine-auto.sh"

# Find open files blocking unmount
lsof +D "/Volumes/<YourTMVolumeName>"

# Reset state file
rm -f "$HOME/Library/Application Support/TimeMachineAuto/last-processed-mount.state"

# Clear lock if needed
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Caches/com.user.timemachine-auto.lock"
```
